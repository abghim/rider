# rider
Basic imitation of the game Rider: Stunt Bike Racing by Ketchapp. Written in python with libraries pygame and pymunk, python layers for SDL2 and Chipmunk2D.
I made this for a school arcade project, so it starts with a screen that prompts you with a 'student id' section. Typing five 0's will get you past the screen. 

I plan to export this to WebAssembly with pygbag soon, but can't make any promises as of now. I have a wasm exported project of the Pacman game, check out the repo.
